## Inspiration
Normally, the place rating system on yelp and google map calculate the overall rating score based on the simple average. It may not an effective guidance for users especially for choosing a restaurant. We focus on looking forward a **personalized** rating algorithm by considering a user's personality from various aspects. From our perspective, our personalized rating score makes real sense.

## What it does
We calculate the restaurant rating based on 9 kinds of categories such as age, interest, income, etc.

## How I built it
The method for calculation is a modified KNN algorithm we designed. Though knn is original a classifier tool, we adopt a way to achieve quantization of these categories.

## Challenges I ran into
Data Analysis and process. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Our idea has very practical meaning for people. Everybody has ever met the situation that they believed the rating from website but they really did not like the taste.
